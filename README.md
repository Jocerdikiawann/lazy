# Lazy

A lightweight and truly native desktop REST client built for developers who prioritize performance and resource efficiency.

## The Story Behind the Project

This project was born out of frustration during daily development. 

Most modern API testing tools and REST clients are built on top of heavy browser engines like Electron. While they offer good features, they act as resource hogs, essentially running an entire web browser in the background just to send a simple HTTP request. For developers working on budget laptops or lower-spec machines, this translates to lagging interfaces, high RAM consumption, and a slowed-down workflow.

This application was created to solve that specific problem. By completely ditching the browser engine and focusing on a 100% native build, it delivers a snappy user interface and a minimal memory footprint. It provides the essential tools you need to test your APIs without draining your computer's resources.

## Core Features

* **Zero Browser Engine:** No Chromium, no Electron, and no web tech overhead. Just pure, native desktop performance.
* **Ultra-Low Memory Footprint:** Consumes a fraction of the RAM compared to mainstream REST clients, making it ideal for older or lower-spec hardware.

## Built With

* [Rust]
* [Iced]
